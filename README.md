csTransPie
------------------------
Inspired by jqtransform  http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/ 

**jqtransform** is included with all the fixes I've found and others I've made

**csTransPie**
is a work in progress - it's designed as one CSS cross-browser file which would give all elements styling they need
(a great library css3Pie is used for IE)


(If you want to see it in action download as zip/tar and run demo.html - csTransPie.css and PIE.htc are part of cssTransPie, other part is jqtransform)

(Project will be set up completely in a week or two)

All suggestions are welcome.
