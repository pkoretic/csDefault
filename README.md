csTransPie
------------------------
Inspired by jqtransform  http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/ 
jqtransform with all the fixes I've found and clean real transparent images for elements included 

csTransPie is a work in progress - it's designed as a one css cross-browser file which would give all elements styling they need
(a great library css3Pie is used for IE)
All suggestions are welcome.
