**live demo** http://www.pkoretic.co.cc/csTransPie/demo.html

Inspired by jqtransform  http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/ 


**csTransPie**
is a work in progress - it's designed as crossbrowser library for styling - one .js file which would give all elements styling they need
(a great library css3Pie is used for IE)


(Project will be set up completely in a week or two)

All suggestions are welcome.
