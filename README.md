csTransPie
------------------------
Inspired by jqtransform  http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/ 

jqtransform is included with all the fixes I've found and others I've made

csTransPie is a work in progress - it's designed as a one css cross-browser file which would give all elements styling they need
(a great library css3Pie is used for IE)
All suggestions are welcome.

(If you want to see it in action download as zip/tar and run demo.html - csTransPie.css and PIE.htc are part of cssTransPie, other part is jqtransform)

(Project will be set up completly in a week or two)
